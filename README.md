# Kristofbc's dotfiles
* I maintain this repository with my current configuration. It always change, thus it is personalized
* Steal it, i'm fine with it

## What about the previous files?
I declared dotfiles bankrupcy last march since 90% of the stuff weren't used.
What i've learned: a base configuration is a great starter, but after a while you should create your own that fits your needs.

## Installation
```bash
$ sh bootstrap.sh
```
